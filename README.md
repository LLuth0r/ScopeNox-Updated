# ScopeNox

This is a modified version of AeonNox by BigNoid. 

It is made to suit people with CIH (Constant Image Height) setups that have the resolution at 1920x1080 and have the projector zoomed so that scope images fill the screen.

Using the normal Kodi skins in this case causes part of the skin to spill outside the scope frame onto walls.

This version of the skin contains all the GUI within an 800/820 pixel height. 

To install simply download the zip file and then within Kodi go to AddOns and 'Install from Zip' and it should install.

In order to switch between 2.35 and 2.40 format go to :
System -> Appearance -> Skin -> Settings -> Scope -> Scope Format (Toggle)

There are two tools for use with this script.  One is scopenox-tools.  This creates the sub-menu buttons for scope masking/zooming.

The other is the scopenox-autozoom script.  With this installed, 16:9 content gets zoomed out so that it's the proper fit on a scope screen.
